# stm32_RC-Car
This project demonstrates how to build and control an RC Car using an STM32 microcontroller. The car's motor speed and direction are controlled via PWM signals generated by the STM32, and commands are received wirelessly via UART communication. The car features real-time speed control, steering mechanisms, and customizable driving modes.
